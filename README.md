### About Me

I'm a graduate student with a strong foundation in **Artificial Intelligence**, passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge data, logic, and impactful applications. My experience spans **machine learning**, **natural language processing**, **data analysis**, and **full-stack development**. I’ve worked on projects ranging from a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline for scientific QA** to **stock market prediction** and **web app development**.

### Key Projects

#### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System
- Built a scalable RAG pipeline using **Gemini Flash 2.0**, **Qdrant**, **LangChain**, and **Hugging Face** for scientific question answering.
- Parsed and chunked 350+ top-cited arXiv CS papers with `pymupdf4llm` and embedded them using transformer models.
- Supported toggleable chat history and Gemini vs. custom RAG responses via user-facing API.

#### Sentiment Analysis - Text Classification
- Complete NLP pipeline using `NLTK`, `Word2Vec`, and models like **Logistic Regression** and **LSTM**.
- Conducted feature engineering, preprocessing, and evaluation using standard ML practices.

#### Stock Market Prediction
- Implemented a hybrid model combining **LSTM** and **A*** to optimize low-volatility, high-return stock picks.

#### Full-Stack Web App – “Kickey”
- Built from scratch using **PHP**, **MySQL**, **HTML/CSS**, hosted on **XAMPP**, including a 3NF database and ER diagram.
